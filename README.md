## Overview
The goal of this project is to preprocess and analyze a diabetes dataset to prepare it for predictive modeling. The notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), handles missing values, and scales features to create a clean and ready-to-use dataset.

## Features
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Provides summary statistics of the dataset.
   - Visualizes the distribution of features.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Replaces invalid values (e.g., zeros in specific columns) with NaN.
   - Imputes missing values using column means.

3. **Data Transformation:**
   - Standardizes features using `StandardScaler`.

4. **Data Splitting:**
   - Splits the dataset into training and testing sets for modeling.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` for data preprocessing

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is related to diabetes prediction. It includes features such as:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (Target variable)

### Data Preprocessing Steps:
1. Identifies and handles missing or invalid values.
2. Normalizes feature values to ensure consistency.
